<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Gas Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser gas analyzers are categorized into two main market types: in-situ and extractive. In-situ analyzers measure gas concentrations directly within the process environment, providing real-time data without sample alteration. This method is often used in harsh industrial conditions, ensuring minimal disruption. Conversely, extractive analyzers collect gas samples from the process, which are then analyzed in a separate system. This approach allows for comprehensive analysis but may involve more complex setup and maintenance, making it suitable for lab environments or when detailed measurements are necessary.</p></p>
