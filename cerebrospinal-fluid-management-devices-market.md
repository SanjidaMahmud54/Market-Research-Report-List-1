<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebrospinal Fluid Management Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CSF Shunts</li><li>CSF Drainage Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) management devices are critical for addressing neurological disorders that involve abnormal fluid accumulation. The market primarily comprises CSF shunts and CSF drainage systems. CSF shunts are implanted devices that redirect excess fluid from the brain to another part of the body, helping to relieve pressure. CSF drainage systems, on the other hand, manage fluid levels through external drainage techniques, allowing for temporary or continuous removal of cerebrospinal fluid to prevent complications from conditions like hydrocephalus.</p></p>
