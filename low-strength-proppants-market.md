<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Strength Proppants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Proppant</li><li>Ultra-low Strength Proppant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The low strength proppants market is categorized into conventional proppants and ultra-low strength proppants. Conventional proppants, such as sand and resin-coated products, provide adequate strength for stabilizing fractures in less demanding conditions. In contrast, ultra-low strength proppants are designed for operations in extremely fragile formations, offering lower density and improved packability, which helps minimize damage to the reservoir while enhancing hydrocarbon flow. Both types address specific well conditions and optimize extraction efficiency in hydraulic fracturing processes.</p></p>
