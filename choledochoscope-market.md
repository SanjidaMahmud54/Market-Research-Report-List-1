<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choledochoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Choledochoscope</li><li>Flexible Choledochoscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The choledochoscope market consists of two primary types: rigid and flexible choledochoscopes. Rigid choledochoscopes are designed for direct visualization of the bile duct during surgical procedures, offering high stability but limited maneuverability. They are typically used in more straightforward cases. In contrast, flexible choledochoscopes provide enhanced maneuverability, allowing access to complex anatomical structures and smaller bile ducts. This flexibility makes them ideal for minimally invasive procedures. Both types play crucial roles in diagnosing and treating bile duct disorders.</p></p>
