<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon expanded Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Stents</li><li>Closed-Loop Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Balloon Expanded Intracranial Stents market features two main types: open-loop stents and closed-loop stents. Open-loop stents possess a design that allows for easier deployment, providing flexibility in navigating the cerebrovascular system. In contrast, closed-loop stents offer enhanced stability and support in maintaining vessel patency, reducing the risk of restenosis. Both types are integral in treating conditions like intracranial aneurysms and stenosis, enabling improved blood flow and overall neurological health.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Balloon expanded Intracranial Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The balloon-expanded intracranial stents market predominantly serves applications related to ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Ischemic strokes, caused by blood vessel blockages, benefit from these stents as they help restore blood flow by supporting narrowed arteries. Conversely, in hemorrhagic strokes, where blood vessels rupture, stents provide vascular reinforcement to prevent further bleeding. The use of these stents enhances patient outcomes by improving cerebral blood circulation and stabilizing affected blood vessels, thus advancing the overall treatment landscape for stroke management.</p></p>
