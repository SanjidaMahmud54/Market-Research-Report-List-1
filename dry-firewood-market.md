<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Firewood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li><10% Moisture Content</li><li>10%-15% Moisture Content</li><li>>15% Moisture Content</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dry firewood market is categorized based on moisture content, influencing usability and efficiency. Firewood with less than 10% moisture is ideal for immediate burning, offering maximum heat output and minimal smoke. The 10%-15% moisture range is acceptable for seasoned wood, suitable for burning but may require slightly longer drying times.
