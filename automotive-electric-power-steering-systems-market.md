<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Electric Power Steering Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>C-EPS</li><li>P-EPS</li><li>R-EPS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Electric Power Steering (EPS) systems include three main types: C-EPS, P-EPS, and R-EPS. C-EPS, or column-assist EPS, integrates the motor into the steering column, offering compact design and cost-effectiveness. P-EPS, or pinion-assist EPS, positions the motor at the pinion gear, providing direct assistance to the steering mechanism for improved responsiveness. R-EPS, or rack-assist EPS, places the motor at the rack, enhancing handling and feedback while allowing for a more dynamic steering experience in various driving conditions.</p></p>
