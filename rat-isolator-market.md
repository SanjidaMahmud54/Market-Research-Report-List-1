<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rat Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolator</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rat isolators are specialized environments designed for handling laboratory rats while ensuring safety and contamination control. Positive pressure isolators maintain a higher internal pressure than the external environment, preventing contaminants from entering, ideal for maintaining sterile conditions. In contrast, negative pressure isolators create a lower internal pressure, allowing contaminants to be contained within the isolator, making them suitable for work with infectious agents. Both types are essential for research applications, ensuring animal welfare and regulatory compliance.</p></p>
